i4oled is a simple helper for setting and rendering OLED icons on Intuos4
family tablets. It uses cairo/pango library to render text and some 'logic'
to split text nicely if it's too long to fit in one line. The main goal
of the project it to develop solutions (splitting text, rendering, png handling,
OLED preparing/writing) that can be used to implement wacom-panel in
gnome-panel-settings, but it's also a fully independent command line tool.

i4oled accepts text or PNG images as input. It can set the OLED icon directly
on tablet or can save PNG image for later use. Expected PNG format is:

PNG image file, has to be 64 x 32, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced

See 'icons' directory for some examples.

Typical usage:

Render text "Ctrl+Alt A" and set OLED icon on Button0:

i4oled -s --text "Ctrl+Alt A" --device  /sys/bus/usb/drivers/wacom/[Dev #]/wacom_led/button0_rawimg

Set OLED icon using existing PNG file:

i4oled -s --image icons/play.png --device /sys/bus/usb/drivers/wacom/[Dev #]/wacom_led/button0_rawimg

Render text to PNG file:

i4oled -s --text "Shift-Meta-X" --output Shift-Meta-X.png 

IMPORTANT NOTE No.1! Make sure OLED brightness is set for the tablet, otherwise icons will remain invisible!
(black on black). It can be done i.e. in this way:

echo 200 > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/wacom/[Dev #]/wacom_led/buttons_luminance

IMPORTANT NOTE No.2! 'Scramble' option has to be used with button#_rawimg. There will be no need to use it if
this patch [1] gets accepted into kernel mainline.
